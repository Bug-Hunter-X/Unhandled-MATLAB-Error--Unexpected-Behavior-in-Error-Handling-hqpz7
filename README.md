# Unhandled MATLAB Error: Unexpected Behavior in Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a scenario where MATLAB's error handling might behave unexpectedly. The `bug.m` file contains a function that throws an error when the input is negative. However, depending on how this function is called or used within a larger program, the error might not be handled or displayed as expected.

The `bugSolution.m` file provides a possible solution to improve error handling and make it more robust.
